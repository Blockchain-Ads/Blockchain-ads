        <p>The non-fungible token (NFT) market has exploded in popularity in recent years, with the total value of NFT sales reaching over $2 billion in 2021 alone. As more and more companies, artists, and content creators begin to explore the potential of NFTs, user acquisition has become a key focus for many in the industry. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the key learnings from existing data and statistics on NFT user acquisition.</p>
        <h4>1. The importance of a strong value proposition</h4>
        <p>One of the most important factors in acquiring and retaining NFT users is the value proposition of your NFTs. This includes the uniqueness and perceived value of the NFT itself, as well as the utility or benefits it provides to the user. For example, an NFT that offers exclusive access to a particular event or experience is likely to be more appealing to users than an NFT that offers little more than bragging rights.</p>
        <h4>2. The role of social media and influencers</h4>
        <p>Social media platforms and influencers have played a significant role in the growth of the NFT market. Many successful NFT projects have used social media and influencers to reach new audiences and drive user acquisition. For example, popular Twitch streamer and NFT collector DrLupo has used his platform to promote and sell NFTs, while the NBA Top Shot NFT platform has leveraged the popularity of professional basketball to drive adoption.</p>
        <h4>3. The importance of education and onboarding</h4>
        <p>Many people are still unfamiliar with NFTs and how they work, so it’s important to provide clear and accessible education and onboarding materials to help new users understand the technology and how to use it. This includes providing easy-to-follow guides and tutorials, as well as offering customer support to answer any questions users may have.</p>
        <h4>4. The role of marketing and advertising</h4>
        <p>Marketing and advertising can also play a key role in NFT user acquisition. While organic growth and word-of-mouth recommendations can certainly be effective, targeted advertising campaigns can also help to reach new audiences and drive adoption.</p>
        <h4>5. The importance of building a strong community</h4>
        <p>Finally, building a strong and engaged community around your NFT project can be a key factor in user acquisition and retention. This includes fostering a sense of community and inclusivity, as well as providing opportunities for users to interact and collaborate with each other.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, user acquisition is a critical factor in the success of any NFT project. By focusing on a strong value proposition, leveraging social media and influencers, providing education and onboarding materials, utilizing marketing and advertising, and building a strong community, you can increase the chances of success for your NFT project.</p>

        description: `<p>Web3 technology, also known as decentralized web or blockchain-based web, is revolutionizing the advertising industry in a number of ways. Here are just a few examples of how web3 is transforming the way that ads are targeted, delivered, and tracked: </p>
        <p>1. Targeting specific groups of users: Traditional online advertising relies on cookies and tracking data to deliver ads to specific users, but this data can be easily manipulated or falsified. With web3, advertisers can use smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to target specific users based on verified data stored on the blockchain. This can help advertisers reach the right audience with the right message, leading to higher conversion rates and better ROI.</p>
        <p>2. Increasing transparency: Traditional online advertising is often opaque, with middlemen taking a cut and making it difficult to track where ad spend is going. With web3, advertisers can use smart contracts and decentralized platforms to track every step of the ad delivery process, from placement to impression. This can help advertisers optimize their ad spend and ensure that their ads are being seen by the intended audience.</p>
        <p>3. Improving security: Because data stored on the blockchain is immutable and transparent, it is much harder for fraudsters to manipulate or falsify. This can help reduce the risk of fraud and improve the overall trustworthiness of the advertising industry.</p>
        <p>4. Enabling programmatic advertising: Web3 technology is also enabling the rise of programmatic advertising, which uses algorithms and real-time data to deliver highly targeted ads to users. Programmatic advertising can be more efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods, and web3 technology is making it possible to scale programmatic advertising on a global level.</p>
        <p>Overall, web3 technology is revolutionizing the advertising industry by providing more targeted, transparent, and secure advertising opportunities. As the technology continues to mature and more advertisers adopt web3 solutions, we can expect to see even more transformative changes in the industry.</p>

        <p>In recent years, the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry has exploded in popularity, with the total value locked in DeFi reaching over $300 billion in 2021. As more and more DeFi projects emerge, user acquisition has become a key focus for many in the industry. In this blog, we’ll take a look at some of the key learnings from our analysis of data from 10 campaigns for DeFi projects on BCA, a web3 advertising platform.</p>
        <h4>The purpose of the analysis:</h4>
        <p>Our goal in conducting this analysis was to understand the effectiveness of advertising on BCA for DeFi projects. To do this, we analyzed data from 10 campaigns run by DeFi projects on the platform. The data sources we used included campaign metrics (e.g., impressions, clicks, conversions) as well as surveys and interviews with campaign stakeholders.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center">...</p>
        <h3>Key findings:</h3>
        <p>Some of the key findings of our analysis included:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>DeFi projects that used clear and compelling messaging in their ads had higher conversion rates compared to those that used more technical or jargon-laden language.</li>
            <li>The use of targeted advertising, such as targeting specific Token holders or users who interact (use) specific chain that the Project is built on top of, was more effective in driving conversions compared to more broad-based campaigns.</li>
            <li>DeFi projects that offered incentives or bonuses to users who completed specific actions (e.g., signing up for an account, completing a transaction) saw higher conversion rates compared to those that did not offer such incentives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: center">...</p>
        <h3>Insights and recommendations:</h3>
        <p>Based on our analysis, we have several insights and recommendations for DeFi projects looking to advertise on BCA:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Use clear and compelling messaging in your ads to attract and retain users.</li>
            <li>Use targeting web3 native users (users who have wallets installed in their browser)</li>
            <li>Consider targeting specific users (Audiences) based on their on-chain data, or on-chain behavior to increase the conversion rates..</li>
            <li>Offer incentives or bonuses to users to encourage them to take specific actions.</li>
            <li>Very clear conversion funnel. (keep it simple stupid)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As more and more Web3 Projects Alpha test our Advertising protocol, we will publish a guide of best practices and strategies based on historical data. Over 20 NFT projects have used Blockchain-Ads for marketing and advertising. While they all achieved a certain degree of success, it’s definitely safe to say that if they (and we) went back in time with the knowledge we have today, we would have achieved the same results in a shorter time and with less ad spend. Today we want to share some of this knowledge to help you achieve outstanding results even quicker. Our experience confirms that, no matter the state of the market, NFTs will always sell if they have real value.</p>
        <h4>Phase 1: Community — Do not Gatekeep!</h4>
        <p>An NFT is not just a JPG. You do not download it from Google Images, you own it. For this reason, you need to give users a reason why they should want to become owners of your NFTs. Without this key factor, it’s easy for users to download a similar picture from the Internet. Here comes the need for community. A 1996 Charizard Pokemon Trading Card costs a fortune because everybody knows what it is and how rare it truly is. How many of the current collectors of the Charizard NFT cards actually played the Pokemon Trading Card game 26 years ago? Probably not too many. This is why we recommend building the community using wide targeting, reaching a few tens of thousands of active users before starting any kind of sales activity. As the community grows, you will see certain trends happening within it, like certain projects being mentioned repeatedly, frequently asked questions, etc… Build your target profile around what the community tells you, not what you want your community to be. 95% of your users will never buy anything from you. Those users are there to validate your project and to make the other 5% want to buy your NFTs.</p>
        <h4>Phase 2 Ticketing — Keeping it exclusive</h4>
        <p>Shifting the Ads’ call to action from “buy NFTs” to “Apply for Waitlist” increases ROI from Ad Campaigns tremendously. This is because of basic human psychology. People browse shopping channels and websites all day but they hardly ever buy anything. However, when you present them with a unique, limited time opportunity, the fear of missing out kicks in. This is why NFT waitlists are so prevalent: you can decide to buy or not to buy an NFT right now, but you may not get the chance to buy that same NFT again for the same price, or possibly at all! Make your community do some work and have them earn a spot on your waitlist. Additionally, make sure your waitlist is over-saturated so that the collection will sell out quickly and you will immediately have a buy wall for a second round. NFT collectors love exclusivity.</p>
        <h4>Phase 3: Auction — Keep building</h4>
        <p>Mint day is approaching, should you shift your Ads to direct sale? Yes and no. While your mint day’s goal is to sell out, you don’t want to open up sales for everyone and kill the exclusivity factor. Instead, advertise how well the project is doing, how quickly the waitlist filled up and what’s next for your project. Remember: Blockchain-Ads has a built-in Wallet Targeting feature that allows you to focus your ad spend towards users who already hold enough token to buy your NFTs. This will remove the arduous task of attracting users who will need to swap in order to buy. Some of the projects who have advertised with Blockchain-Ads over-saturated their waitlist and were able to sell out on mint day. The first collection is your proof of concept. Once this has proven to be successful, your community will desire subsequent collections and enable the further development of your NFT project.</p>

        description: `
        <p>With the death of 3rd party cookies and the termination of Google Universal Analytics, it is certainly going to be a time of upheaval for marketing departments of all companies around the world. As Google and Meta’s proposed alternatives are vague at best and no solution yet on the market for web3 actors, we are entering a phase of opportunity, in which data insights will give you a massive competitive advantage, no matter the difference in competitor size.</p>
        <h4>Enter Blockchain-Ads Web3 Data Attribution</h4>
        <p>After over 6 months of development, Blockchain-Ads and its partner Vulos.io are proud to announce a first-of-its-kind Web3 Data Attribution Analytics portal that lets advertisers see performance and results filtered by Wallets, Web3 Audiences and Web3 Publisher Categories. In addition, our all-in-one Attribution technology gives unmatched transparency to all advertisers by reporting on Blockchain transactions and reverse-engineering the users’ journey back to the ad that triggered the conversions.</p>
        <h4>How it works</h4>
        <p>There are two main ingredients in our Data Attribution mix: wallets and on-chain transactions. Users connect their wallet to the Blockchain-Ads Share-to-Earn protocol and start being rewarded for the data they willingly share with the protocol.</p>
        <p>Publishers install the Blockchain-Ads tracking script, which tracks what types of wallets visit their websites and apps. They earn the majority of rewards.</p>
        <p>Advertisers choose which chain they want to target, along with which profiles and many other key distinguishers of their intended audience. For example, are you an NFT project built on Ethereum Blockchain? During this bear market, you may want to target only those users who hold enough ETH to meet your NFT price point.</p>
        <p>All of this data is stored on a permission-based decentralized Blockchain. Blockchain-Ads records on-chain transactions and reports back to advertisers the full users’ journey on the Blockchain-Ads ecosystem that triggered the transaction. Users log onto the Blockchain-Ads protocol through their wallets (no email, name, etc…) This data is 100% anonymous and secure. Our permission-based Blockchain ensures that no 3rd parties have access to this data. Advertisers can only see interaction between themselves and the wallets that are connected to them.</p>
        <p>If you wish to learn more about the Blockchain-Ads technology, please read our article about the Wallet Targeting capabilities of our protocol: https://medium.com/@blockchain-ads.com/what-is-wallet-targeting-and-how-it-increase-advertising-roi-272129696a63</p>
        <h4>Benefits outside of Web3</h4>
        <p>With the death of 3rd party cookies, we are aware that all those who spend money in advertising are looking for alternatives to retain full data attribution of their marketing campaigns. Since even Google is going away from Last Click Attribution (a biased system used by most CRMs and Analytics platforms), non-Web3 companies are also interested in an on-Blockchain Data Management Platform. The Blockchain is the only technology in existence to offer cookieless, immutable, anonymous and secure data attribution. For this reason, Blockchain-Ads is expanding to non-Web3 Publisher Categories, as well as looking for Advertisers to test performance.</p>

        description: `
        <p>A short while ago, Blockchain-Ads mentioned Wallet Targeting among the core features of the Alpha stage platform. We received overwhelming support from within and without our community regarding this new technology and, along with the praises, our team also received a lot of questions regarding how it works, what are the benefits, and how to start using it for advertising.</p>
        <p>In this article we are going to give you a brief overview of how Wallet Targeting works and what are the pros for all Web3 projects.</p>
        <p>Note: As Blockchain-Ads is in closed Alpha, we are expanding and adapting our features based on the client feedback and on how the market evolves. Although there are going to be changes, the concept and technology foundations will largely stay the same.</p>
        <h4>What is Wallet Targeting Technology</h4>
        <p>Wallet Targeting Advertising means being able to serve personalized ads to Web3 Users based on their wallet portfolio and activities. For example, you may want to show a specific ad to people who recently bought at least a certain amount of BNB Coins. This is an extremely powerful tool with unlimited possibilities. As more and more people enter the crypto market, you may want to restrict your audience pool to veteran crypto users to avoid having to educate your website visitors. Alternatively, you may have an NFT marketplace built on the NEAR protocol and you may want to target specifically NEAR wallets to increase your advertising efficiency. But there is more: This very same technology is the pillar of Web3-powered data attribution. Have you ever wondered who buys your token? How did they learn about your project and what made them buy? Imagine how beneficial it would be to find out which Marketing activities bring you the most transactions.</p>
        <h4>Why did nobody do this before?</h4>
        <p>The first part of the technology consists of a massive network of API which scrapes Open Ledger Blockchains for transactions and profiles all wallets into an unified database; kind of like what websites such as https://whale-alert.io/ are doing. However, this is not enough. The second crucial step is to find these wallets on the open Internet (and the Metaverse, more on this soon™?), in order to serve them your ads. This is why Blockchain-Ads is developing an ‘AdNFT’ solution, in which users can store and control their non-PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and earn rewards, as well as personalizing their Internet experience. With the AdNFT, not only you will be able to earn from navigating the Internet even outside platforms like Brave, but you will also be able to choose which ads you see. Are you an Algorand supporter? Would it not be cool to see ads about cool emerging projects built on Algorand, instead of being targeted by NFT marketplaces or other projects that require you to be holding other coins you currently don’t have?</p>
        <h4>What about Privacy?</h4>
        <p>AdNFT will be a fully decentralized solution built on a Permission-based Blockchain. The system is currently used — for example — for payment validation and document certification without the involvement of third-party data providers. For more information, we suggest you visit our partner’s website https://vulos.io/. As this data is processed on the Blockchain, Advertisers will be able to target wallets and monitor the performance of their Marketing campaigns without actually seeing the wallet numbers. This is currently the strongest form of data anonymization out there at the moment.</p>

        description: `
        <p>Two weeks ago, the Blockchain-Ads Team had the opportunity to have Jasmine, from Coinbag.Finance as the special guest of our AMA. Together, we discussed the potential uses of Blockchain-Ads’ new Wallet Targeting capabilities to target Web3 Users based on their crypto investments portfolio, as well as the Soulbound NFT concept announced by Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin.</p>
        <h4>What is Coinbag Finance and its mission</h4>
        <p>As Jasmine put it: “we want to introduce crypto investors of all backgrounds and experiences into this space and give them all the tools necessary to actively engage and learn as part of the crypto investment community. […] And finally, a core feature of our product that we’re super excited about is offering themed bundles separated by chain protocol and token. What this means is that you can select the bundle that they like to gain exposure to, and we will show you all the protocols that will help meet your financial goals and the algorithm maximizes earned interest according to your investment strategy.”</p>
        <h4>How Wallet Targeting can provide high ROI for Blockchain-based projects in the current market.</h4>
        <p>Despite the market conditions, it is interesting to see how much attention the Blockchain space is currently attracting. All of the hype and news surrounding Blockchain has actually turned all eyes and ears towards the space. In these pivotal times, Web3 projects are faced with education attrition: new people often think that crypto is all about investing into Ethereum and Bitcoin and waiting with fingers crossed that the values triple overnight. This is of course not the case, as it actually takes a lot of education to encourage people to explore all the protocols and all the strategies to earn interest in crypto. Ideally, one wants to target people who are already in Crypto. One wants to target those crypto wallets so that they don’t have to waste time on educating them. The chance to target people who are interested in crypto would make onboarding on any Crypto-related project easy and seamless.</p>
        <h4>Soulbound NFTs as the pathway to a decentralized society</h4>
        <p>“It is a way to do Web3 social credentialing. So then instead of just targeting users based on wallet sizes and wallet address, you can target people who elect to share this data based on their credentials, which communities they are part of and what is their role in these communities.”</p>
        <p>For those who do not know, a Soulbound NFT is a non-transferable, non-fungible token which belongs to only one user. This gives users a better way to truly control what data they share on the web and with whom they share it. A similar concept — AdNFT — has already been in development by the Blockchain-Ads team for the past 6 months and will enable users to personalize their ad experience on the Web while earning token rewards without limitations of Browser.</p>

        <p>Blockchain-Ads is the first “Performance-based Web3 Advertising Ecosystem”. There is so much inside these 5 words. What does Performance-based means? What is a Web3 Advertising Ecosystem? We want to unpack all of this in this (short) article.</p>
        <p>If you have already heard about us before or you want to go more in depth on our technology and ecosystem, here is a few resources we suggest you to check:</p>

        </ul>
        <br/>
        <h4>A New Era Of Advertising Is Upon Us. Whether We Want It Or Not.</h4>
        <p>The current decade is proving to be a pivotal time for Web Advertising. The death of 3rd Party Cookies, the widespread use of Blockchain technology and the advent of virtual IDs are only a few of the recent developments in Digital Marketing and User Privacy in recent years.</p>
        <p>All companies and projects that interact with the Blockchain in one way or another (DeFi, Crypto, NFTs, Gaming, Metaverse, etc…) have already felt the consequences of this new era, as their potential customers, once so easy to reach, are now extremely hard to find on the open Web.</p>
        <h4>Blockchain-Ads is building the plumbing of the new Era of Advertising on the Web3.0 — the hard way.</h4>
        <p>Blockchain Ads is developing the first one unified Marketing solution for all Web3 Projects. A Meta-Hub that combines the latest Advertising technologies for advertisers, total Privacy protection and control for Web users and seamless setup process for all publishers to monetize their content without any requirement.</p>
        <h4>The End Result</h4>
        <p>Privacy Protection on par with the Brave Browser, but unrestricted by platform. Advertising ROI on par with Google & Facebook, but without the restrictions. Traffic Analysis on par with Google Analytics, but without invading users’ Privacy.</p>
        <h4>But there is more: The Metaverse</h4>
        <p>Yes, the Metaverse. Single plots of lands go by $10,000+ — sometimes more than the real thing. Bored Ape Yacht Club sale of virtual land overwhelmed and broke the Ethereum Blockchain.</p>
        <p>Two of the — missing — key selling points of the Metaverse are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>An easy way to monetize your space</li>
            <li>An easy way to know who sees and interacts with your virtual property</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>Well, things are changing. Blockchain-Ads has already created what we call a MetaHUB: a forum of smart and creative Metaverse projects to come together and create partnerships to develop one of the first iterations of Metaverse Ads, Metaverse Data Attribution.</p>
        <p>Many more things are cooking within and without the Blockchain-Ads Ecosystem. The team is hyped to announce some of these in the upcoming days and weeks. In the meantime, if you have any questions, or you simply want to become part of our Hub, you can reach out to us at contact@blockchain-ads.com or on our Telegram channel.</p>

        <p>Imagine a Web3 Advertising Ecosystem with the Performance of Google Ads, the level of Data Attribution and Segmentation of Google Analytics and the Privacy protection of the Brave Browser. Is it possible?</p>
        <p>Today the Blockchain-Ads Team is thrilled to announce our first Strategic Partnership with Cookie3: the First Analytics Platform that translates on-chain data into behavioral profiles of individuals.</p>
        <h4>What does this partnership mean for Web3 Advertising?</h4>
        <p>One of the most common challenges of Web3 Projects is how difficult it is for them to reach their audience, be it Early token investors, NFT holders, DeFi degens and so on…</p>
        <p>Cookie3 is developing a one-of-its-kind Analytics platform that enables you to match your on-chain data with off-chain without losing privacy of the individuals. This enables Data segmentation and profiling, as well as — among other benefits — let you know your (and your competitors’) user onchain data category and segmentation. Since Web3 started, projects have had to do their marketing in the dark, not knowing where their users are, what is their buyer’s journey and what triggers they respond to. This is about to change</p>
        <h4>Immutable and Decentralized Data Attribution: User Segmentation like Google Analytics, with the Privacy Protection of the Web3</h4>
        <p>Countless Marketing and Martech papers are coming out everyday discussing the future of the advertising industry after the death of Third Party Cookies in Web2. 2023 will be a year of disruption, in which companies will have to start making without relying on big data companies to harvest users data and sell it to them for their Marketing activities. There is only one solution for companies wanting to keep effective Marketing outreach and users to reliably safeguard their privacy. This solution is the Blockchain technogoly and the web3 dapps. While Cookie3 will be data engine processing and interpreting all existing NFTs, smart contracts, and tokens on a variety of chains, Blockchain-Ads Protocol will be able to match and idenity those users when they move across the web enabling precise targeting without interupting users privacy.</p>
        <h4>Precise Targeting and Data Attribution for the Metaverse</h4>
        <p>While the Blockchain-Ads team has been hard at work to develop a performance-based Advertising solution for the Metaverse, the Cookie 3 team is about to launch the profiling engine that will segment and categorize the Metaverse audince and massively attribute to Bloickchain-ads to be able to delivering the right ads in front of the right users of the Metaverse. This has massive implications for the entire industry, as it was one of the key missing pieces for reliable monetization of Metaverse spaces, projects and initiatives.</p>
        <h4>What’s Next?</h4>
        <p>As true Web3 Advertising performance becomes reality, our team is already creating and testing new creative ways to make the most out of Web2 & Web3 data connections. More partnerships have already been signed and we are looking forward to announcing them to the public. In the meantime, we are open for all Web3 projects to test us out. If you would like to get in touch with the team, you can do so at contact@blockchain-ads.com and on our Telegram channel.</p>
        <p>We also strongly encourage our readers to learn more about the Cookie3 amazing project at https://cookie3.co/ and on their Twitter Account and Telegram Account.</p>
