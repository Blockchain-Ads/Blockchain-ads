        <p>1. Targeting specific groups of users: Traditional online advertising relies on cookies and tracking data to deliver ads to specific users, but this data can be easily manipulated or falsified. With web3, advertisers can use smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to target specific users based on verified data stored on the blockchain. This can help advertisers reach the right audience with the right message, leading to higher conversion rates and better ROI.</p>
        <p>2. Increasing transparency: Traditional online advertising is often opaque, with middlemen taking a cut and making it difficult to track where ad spend is going. With web3, advertisers can use smart contracts and decentralized platforms to track every step of the ad delivery process, from placement to impression. This can help advertisers optimize their ad spend and ensure that their ads are being seen by the intended audience.</p>
        <p>3. Improving security: Because data stored on the blockchain is immutable and transparent, it is much harder for fraudsters to manipulate or falsify. This can help reduce the risk of fraud and improve the overall trustworthiness of the advertising industry.</p>
        <p>4. Enabling programmatic advertising: Web3 technology is also enabling the rise of programmatic advertising, which uses algorithms and real-time data to deliver highly targeted ads to users. Programmatic advertising can be more efficient and cost-effective than traditional methods, and web3 technology is making it possible to scale programmatic advertising on a global level.</p>
        <p>Overall, web3 technology is revolutionizing the advertising industry by providing more targeted, transparent, and secure advertising opportunities. As the technology continues to mature and more advertisers adopt web3 solutions, we can expect to see even more transformative changes in the industry.</p>

        <p>In recent years, the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry has exploded in popularity, with the total value locked in DeFi reaching over $300 billion in 2021.

            <li>DeFi projects that used clear and compelling messaging in their ads had higher conversion rates compared to those that used more technical or jargon-laden language.</li>
            <li>The use of targeted advertising, such as targeting specific Token holders or users who interact (use) specific chain that the Project is built on top of, was more effective in driving conversions compared to more broad-based campaigns.</li>
            <li>DeFi projects that offered incentives or bonuses to users who completed specific actions (e.g., signing up for an account, completing a transaction) saw higher conversion rates compared to those that did not offer such incentives.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: center">...</p>
        <h3>Insights and recommendations:</h3>
        <p>Based on our analysis, we have several insights and recommendations for DeFi projects looking to advertise on BCA:</p>
